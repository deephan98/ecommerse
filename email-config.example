# To generate an App Password:
# 1. Go to your Google Account settings
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to Security > App passwords
# 4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
# 5. Use that password in EMAIL_PASS

# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual email credentials
# Then restart your server for the changes to take effect
